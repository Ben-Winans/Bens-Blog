# Portfolio Project

## Introduction
Welcome to my personal portfolio project, a web application built using Vite and React. This project showcases my skills, projects, and experiences as a programmer.

To view the prototype first go to the figma I've created for this project 
https://www.figma.com/file/YRQXBYoCVgcCiCUUzTDBax/Ben's-Bog?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=fzyAfQ1p1tB6Q7Q1-1

Then, on the figma select the frame "Final Layout - desktop" and click the arrow in the top right hand corner for "present". This will let you see a prototype of the website I am programming until the live site is finished. 


## Features
- **Performance Optimized:** Leverages Vite for efficient bundling and fast loading times.

## Technologies Used
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite:** A modern frontend build tool that significantly improves the development experience.
- **CSS Modules:** For scoped and maintainable stylesheets.

## Project Setup
If you like this portfolio project and want to use it as a template for your own, you can easily do so by forking the repository. Here's how:

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   - Navigate to the original repository on GitHub.
   - In the top-right corner of the page, click the "Fork" button. This creates a copy of the project in your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository:**
   - Once forked, go to your GitHub profile, find the repository, and open it.
   - Click the "Code" button and copy the URL provided.
   - Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project, and run:
     ```
     git clone [copied-url]
     ```
     Replace `[copied-url]` with the URL you copied.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Navigate into the cloned directory:
     ```
     cd [repository-name]
     ```
     Replace `[repository-name]` with the name of the forked repository.
   - Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
     ```
     npm install
     ```

4. **Personalize and Modify:**
   - Now that you have a local copy, you can start personalizing and modifying the portfolio to suit your needs.

5. **Push Changes to Your Fork:**
   - As you make changes, commit them and push back to your forked repository on GitHub. This way, you maintain a version-controlled history of your own modifications.
