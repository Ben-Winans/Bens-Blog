                    <p>I love building applications that are scalable, impactful and creative.</p>
                    <p>I studied Computer Engineering at the University of Florida where I gained experience in Web-development, Operating Systems, Cyber-security and IOT technology. I spent 1 year working as the sole technical contributor to a full-stack application where I learned how to fulfil a project from ideation to completion. </p>
                    <p>In these experiences Iâ€™ve learned how to work independently and on small teams, both specialized and cross-functional. My work style emphasizes being easy to approach, effective when communicating and thorough when researching.</p>
                    <p>I am currently looking for a new role as a developer. Hire me? </p>
